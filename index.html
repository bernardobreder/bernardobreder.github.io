            <h1 id="how-i-think">How I Think</h1>
            <p>I follow a three-step process to develop any feature or solution for an application. First, it’s essential to sit
    down with the user to fully understand their world. It’s important to think about how their mind works to truly
    grasp and feel the problem they are facing with the application. Once you understand their perspective, the next
    step is to devise the best possible solution for their problem. This solution needs to be exceptional for the user,
    even if it’s complex to implement. Users don’t want to change their specifications simply because it’s challenging
    to build what they need. They expect an application that solves their problem exactly as envisioned during the
    initial discussions. Your goal is to deliver the best solution possible within the available time and technology,
    even if it means creating helper libraries to support your implementation. These libraries often make the code more
    readable and manageable. Ultimately, the final solution should be simple yet perfect for the user. If the problem is
    highly complex, it can help to narrow the application’s scope or focus on the most critical functionality currently
    used by the user—without altering the original specifications. What truly matters is that the solution meets the
    user’s expectations while being simple, understandable, and easy to use.</p>
<p>My strongest background in backend development is with Java, but I have also studied Apple technologies extensively
    for frontend development. These two environments complement each other perfectly, as Java is excellent for building
    robust backend servers, and Apple’s philosophy and technology are ideal for creating exceptional user experiences. I
    believe the best solutions are achieved when each problem is addressed in the appropriate layer. For example, you
    cannot solve a server-side problem in the client application, nor can you resolve a client-side issue on the server.
    Without a comprehensive understanding of both technologies, it’s easy to make such mistakes. Whenever I’m
    developing, I constantly ask myself: *Is this problem specific to the server, or is it related to the client
    application?*</p>
<p>I enjoy creating projects where I see an opportunity to introduce something new. There are many products available
    that fail to meet the real demands of users. When I encounter such a scenario and have the time to analyze and think
    through the problem, I study it and build a prototype of my proposed solution. Those who know and work with me
    understand that I love solving problems by prototyping, as it allows me to uncover new insights and gain a deeper
    understanding of the problem.</p>
<p>In both my personal and professional projects, I adopt a component-oriented approach and test each step of
    development incrementally. I use TDD (Test-Driven Development) to implement components, ensuring that all planned
    tests are written before the component is finalized. When it comes to creating user interfaces—regardless of the
    technology or programming language—I prefer using the Passive View pattern. <a

</p>
<p>This curriculum is detailed because it serves as a comprehensive timeline of my professional projects. Each project represents a significant milestone in my career and highlights the progress and growth I have achieved over time. I appreciate your understanding if it feels a bit lengthy.</p>

                    <p>My main personal project is called **StmtNode** <a href="http://stmtnode.com">[13]</a>. This project is a development
    platform featuring a custom IDE and a proprietary programming language designed specifically for creating unique
    applications. The key innovation of this IDE and programming language is its ability to generate code for various
    programming languages, as if it were written manually by a developer. For example, a project developed within this
    IDE and language can be converted into a Java project, a Node.js client/server application, an Apple application, or
    other technologies, depending on the implemented code generators.</p>
<p>I am the sole developer of this project and dedicate my free time to its implementation because I believe it is a
    groundbreaking tool that I will also use in my other personal projects.</p>

                   <p>The new generation of GPU architectures enables the concurrent execution of multiple kernels on the same hardware. This feature significantly enhances the computational power of GPUs, as it allows the simultaneous execution of different tasks. However, the hardware's decision-making process for execution order heavily depends on the sequence in which kernels are submitted. This often results in suboptimal hardware utilization.</p> <p>This work proposes a novel optimization approach to reorder kernel submissions, focusing on maximizing resource utilization and improving the average turnaround time. The method models the simulation of kernel execution and hardware resources as a knapsack problem and applies greedy and dynamic programming algorithms to solve it. The results, measured using kernels of varying sizes and resource requirements, demonstrate significant gains in average turnaround time and system throughput compared to standard concurrent kernel execution.</p>

                    <p>Projects with specific requirements often demand specialized programming languages. These languages should provide the necessary tools to enable efficient and effective implementation. While some projects prioritize enhancing the modularity of their architecture and focus on high-level development, others require optimized runtime performance, leveraging low-level programming features.</p> <p>The **Breder Programming Language** was created to address the needs of projects requiring both high-level abstraction and low-level performance by optimizing the integration between these two layers. This work outlines the key characteristics of the Breder Programming Language and demonstrates how it can be used to achieve seamless development across varying levels of complexity.</p>

          <p>The increasing computational power and resources of modern GPUs have reignited interest in optimizing the sharing of these resources among multiple kernels. While new generations of GPUs support concurrent kernel execution, the scheduling decisions are made by the hardware at runtime. However, these hardware decisions are highly dependent on the order in which kernels are submitted for execution, often leading to suboptimal resource utilization.
In this work, we propose a novel optimization approach to reorder kernel invocations, aiming to maximize resource utilization and improve average turnaround time. We model the assignment of kernels to hardware resources as a series of knapsack problems and solve them using a dynamic programming approach. To evaluate our method, we tested it with kernels of varying sizes and resource requirements. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in average turnaround time and system throughput when compared to the default kernel submission strategies used in modern GPUs.</p>

         <p>Sharing GPUs is becoming a critical trend in high-performance computing, particularly in virtual GPU environments designed to meet the diverse demands of customers in cloud-based systems. In this context, GPUs must efficiently manage varying application loads while maintaining compatible throughput.
This work focuses on kernel scheduling for GPU execution, specifically presenting strategies to determine the optimal order for scheduling kernels. Since this is an optimization problem, it can be formulated as a 0-1 knapsack problem. To address this, we propose the use of a greedy heuristic to solve the knapsack problem. We also evaluate the performance and overhead of the greedy method compared to the dynamic programming approach.

Our results demonstrate that the greedy method achieves competitive performance with significantly lower execution overhead, making it a viable solution for large-scale environments.</p>

            <p>This paper, propose a new framework definition for programming to iPhone with simplicity and productively. With
                this way, the developer can create a application, thinking only the logic of the game, forgeting the difficulties
                of framework and native Language for programming to iPhone.</p>
            <p> This framework has simple and objective features to ensure the practicality of programming for iPhone. For this,
                we implemented a specification based on typical game framework architectures, which meets these requirements
                by using a Programming Language.</p>
            <p> The Objetive-C Language used for programming to iPhone is a low level Language[STEPHEN G. KOCHAN]. With this,
                the developer need to implement and manager many thinks in the environment that should not worry. Because
                of that, it will be good if the devel- oper can use a high level Language in which will only worry about
                the logic of the application.</p>
            <p> In this paper, will be used the Breder Programming Language for implement this framework. It because, the Breder
                Language is a high level Language that has many features to ensure the further structuring of code and productivity
                [BREDER, B]. Moreover, this Language was developed to assist projects that require high effi- ciency in native
                method call deployed in some external library, that will be use for comunication with iPhone framework [BREDER,
                B].

            <h4>Single Virtual Machile
                <a href="pub/pdf/swas.pdf">[71]</a>
            </h4>
            <p>The project proposal is to create a web site development environment that integrates a new and unique programming
                language into the project to a remote host coming from a remote server service.</p>
            <p>The main goal of the project is to "marry" between a unique programming language and a remote host, so that together
                they can interact and gain development resources not available in many environments. In addition, this "marriage"
                can have a greater approximation between the client's project and the resources that the machines need for
                their execution.</p>
            <p>With the semantic and semantic analysis information and execution context captured by the new programming language
                used by the client, the remote machine will be able to better manage its resources for execution, and may
                also shift the project execution context of a machine to another at run time when more or less hardware resource
                is requested. In this way, a running web project can be moved from one machine to another without interference
                in the execution line, totally transparent to the client, providing management more adequate to the machine
                resources.
            </p>
            <p>With this project execution context-shifting feature, remote machines can self-manage in a way that maximizes
                the capabilities of the machines in the face of running projects.</p>

            <p>This project is a proposal of a new operating system with integrates knowledge of database, structure data e
                many other library and framework. This study is more detailed at the link above.</p>

                    <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br">[82]</a> to learn about how can i create a circuit of hardware using software programming language. This
                    course is wonderful for me because in my monograph i want to create a microprocessor that interpreter
                    the instruction of the Breder Programming Language.

                <h4>Breder Programming Language</h4>
                <p>Projects with specific requirements require specific programming languages. These programming languages should
                    provide tools for a better implementation. Some projects aim at improving the modularity of its architecture,
                    focusing on high level development while others require a better runtime performance, using low level
                    programming features. </p>
                <p>Breder Programming Language was designed to meet the requirements of projects that require high level and
                    low level development by optimizing the interconnections between those levels. This work describes the
                    characteristics of the Breder programming language and how to use it.</p>

                <h4>Ordering of the Submission of Concurrent Kernels to Maximize Utilization of GPU Resources</h4>
                <p>New generation of Architectures GPUs allow concurrent execution kernels on the same hardware. This feature
                    can increases the power of these devices, since it makes possible the concurrent execution of different
                    tasks on the same hardware. However, the hardware decisions about the order execution depends heavily
                    the order at which the kernels are submitted, causing the utilization of the hardware is not optimized.
                </p>
                <p>This work propose a novel optimization approach to reorder the kernels submittion focusing on maximizing
                    the resources utilization, improving the average turnaround time. The model the simulation of the kernels
                    with the hardware resources modeling as a knapsack problems and use algorithm greedy and dynamic programming
                    approach to solve them. The results are measure using kernels with different sizes and resource requirements,
                    resulting a significant gains in the average turnaround time and system throughput compared with a standard
                    execution of concurrent kernels.

                <h4>Maximizando o Uso dos Recursos de GPU Através da Reordenação da Submissão de Kernels Concorrentes</h4>
                <p>The increasing amount of resources available on current GPUs sparked new interest in the problem of sharing
                    its resources by different kernels. While new generation of GPUs support concurrent kernel execution,
                    their scheduling decisions are taken by the hardware at runtime. The hardware decisions, however, heavily
                    depend on the order at which the kernels are submitted to execution.
                </p>
                <p>In this work, we propose a novel optimization approach to reorder the kernels invocation focusing on maximizing
                    the resources utilization, improving the average turnaround time. We model the kernels assignments to
                    the hardware resources as a series of knapsack problems and use dynamic programming approach to solve
                    them. We evaluate our method using kernels with different sizes and resource requirements. Our results
                    show significant gains in the average turnaround time and system throughput compared to the standard
                    kernels submission implemented in modern GPUs.</p>

                <h4>Breder Programming Language for iPhone Game Programming</h4>
                <p>This paper, propose a new framework definition for programming to iPhone with simplicity and productively.
                    With this way, the developer can create a application, thinking only the logic of the game, forgeting
                    the difficulties of framework and native Language for programming to iPhone.</p>
                <p> This framework has simple and objective features to ensure the practicality of programming for iPhone. For
                    this, we implemented a specification based on typical game framework architectures, which meets these
                    requirements by using a Programming Language.</p>
                <p> The Objetive-C Language used for programming to iPhone is a low level Language[STEPHEN G. KOCHAN]. With this,
                    the developer need to implement and manager many thinks in the environment that should not worry. Because
                    of that, it will be good if the devel- oper can use a high level Language in which will only worry about
                    the logic of the application.</p>
                <p> In this paper, will be used the Breder Programming Language for implement this framework. It because, the
                    Breder Language is a high level Language that has many features to ensure the further structuring of
                    code and productivity [BREDER, B]. Moreover, this Language was developed to assist projects that require
                    high effi- ciency in native method call deployed in some external library, that will be use for comunication
                    with iPhone framework [BREDER, B].</p>
